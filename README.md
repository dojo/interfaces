This package contain TypeScript interfaces and types that are widely used across Dojo 2 packages.  It is designed to make it
easier to maintain these interfaces as well as build code that integrates well with the rest of the Dojo 2 packages without
requiring a hard dependency on those other packages.

**WARNING** This is _beta_ software. While we do not anticipate significant changes to the API at this stage, we may feel the need to do so. This is not yet production ready, so you should use at your own risk.

## Usage

To use `@dojo/interfaces` install the package:

```bash
npm install @dojo/interfaces
```

## Features

### bases

`Evented` and `Destroyable` interfaces, which are used throughout many packages, specifically`@dojo/core` and `@dojo/widget-core`.

`Evented` defines an interface for objects that emit events, while `Destroyable` defines an interface for objects that have `own` and `destroy` methods.

### core

Common, foundational interfaces used widely throughout most Dojo 2 packages. Includes `Handle` and event related interfaces `EventObject`, and `EventTargettedObject`.

### loader

Interfaces for working with `@dojo/loader`.  If the loader is included on the page, you can reference the loader with:

```typescript
import { DojoRequire } from '@dojo/interfaces/loader';
declare const require: DojoRequire;

require(['some-module'], (someModule) => {
});
```

### shim

`Thenable` and `ArrayLike` interfaces. `Thenable` will allow you to use promise-like objects without pulling in `@dojo/shim`.

### vdom

A set of interfaces for working with widgets and the virtual DOM. To work with a `VNode`:

```typescript
import { VNode } from '@dojo/interfaces/vdom';

let node: VNode;

node = someFlag ? v('div') : v('p');
```
